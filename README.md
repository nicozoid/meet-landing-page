This is a solution to a [challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/meet-landing-page-rbTDS6OUR).


### Learrnings
- How to draw simple shapes in CSS and overlay them with other elements.
- How to get elements to overlap one another.
- How to adding a semi-opaque background colour.

### Challenges
- How to have the hero image exceed the viewport width on mobile, without messing up the widths of all the other elements.
- Aspects of CSS Grid are still me playing about with it rather than full grasping it.

### Slightly-refined process
1. Set up readme. Add `/design` to .gitignore.
1. Create HTML, inc. containers & class names, inc. text styles.
1. Create variables (e.g. color, spacing). Mobile only.
1. Text styles: define classes (direct from figma), import fonts.
1. Define layout/style of all remaining CSS classes. Mobile only.
1. Define hover states and transitions
1. Adjust the CSS as needed for tablet and desktop

### Questions
Always interested in thoughts on whether there is a point in learning any this given the state of AI. I'm learning frontend coding in the belief that AI code still needs human oversight and I can't provide that oversight without coding proficiency. I wonder if even that will be true in a year though.# testimonials-grid-section
